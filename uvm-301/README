In uvm-201, we added a data packet and the driver. So, until now we had only 4 
verification components.

Previous Sessions :
Test           uvm-101
Env            uvm-101
Data           uvm-201
Driver         uvm-201

This session : 
Sequencer      uvm-301
Monitor        uvm-301

Drawbacks of previous testbench structure
1. Limited verification components
2. Data packet is generated inside the driver
3. "n_times" variable cannot be configured from outside
4. Protocol to send data is hard coded in the main_phase
5. DUT Interface was passed only to the Driver instead of all components

In this session, we'll add a "sequencer" and a "monitor" to our testbench.
The role of the sequencer is to generate data packets, and send it to the DUT.
The role of the monitor is to monitor the DUT output
